# Simple React App Template

This is a simple basic app. `frontend` contains the frontend code, using react, and `backend` contains the backend code, using node.js and express.

## Setting up MongoDB

Before starting, you need to install `mongodb`. On MacOS, this is just:

```
brew install mongodb-community
```

## Development

In one terminal, start the backend:

```
cd backend
npx nodemon .
```

Now switch to another terminal, and start the frontend dev server:

```
cd frontend
npm start
```
