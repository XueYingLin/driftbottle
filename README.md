# Simple React App Template

This is a simple basic app. `frontend` contains the frontend code, using react, and `backend` contains the backend code, using node.js and express.

## Developing the frontend

You can start a frontend development server via:

```
cd frontend
npm start
```

To build a (production) version of the frontend, you can:

```
cd backend
npm run build
```

## Developing the backend
